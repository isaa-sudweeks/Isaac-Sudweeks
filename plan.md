# Website Updates Plan

## Goals (from your notes)
- Make the active navigation tab more obvious.
- Shift the site messaging toward grad school preparation and research focus.
- Add project images from the portfolio PDF.
- Add a blog-style page for writing (class pieces + ideas).
- Check Obsidian for other website ideas.

## Proposed execution order
1. **Audit nav + layout**: identify current nav patterns and where to enhance the active state (likely CSS + nav markup).
2. **Grad school emphasis**: update hero copy, section headings, and stats on `index.html`, plus supporting updates in `experience.html` and `work.html`.
3. **Project images**: extract relevant images from `Isaac's Stuff/Portfolio_Summer_2025.pdf`, organize them in a new `assets/` folder, and add image blocks to project cards.
4. **Blog screen**: add a new `writing.html` page, add it to the main nav, and add starter entries + layout for posts.
5. **Obsidian scan**: search Obsidian for website ideas and incorporate any relevant sections.

## Dependencies / decisions
- **Project images**: I will extract images from `Isaac's Stuff/Portfolio_Summer_2025.pdf` and map each to the correct project card. If you want specific images per project, tell me which page/image corresponds to each project.
- **Blog content**: provide titles + short excerpts + dates, or I can add placeholders and you can fill in later.
- **Obsidian**: my search tool failed due to a connection/config issue. If you want me to run that search, please confirm your Obsidian MCP setup or point me at the relevant note(s).
